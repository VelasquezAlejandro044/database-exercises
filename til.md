# How to Verify Your Monthly Housing Stipend Once Enrolled
 
In order to receive your monthly housing stipend, you must verify your attendance each month. Verifying your attendance is quick and easy.  Following each month of training, please email the Buffalo VET TEC processing team at VETTEC.VBABUF@va.gov  to confirm your attendance for the previous month. 
In your email please include the following:
·         First, Middle Initial and Last Name
·         The month(s) you are verifying attendance
·         DO NOT include your social security number (SSN) or other sensitive personal information, such as orders, direct deposit information or address changes.
It is your responsibility to submit a monthly verification of attendance at the beginning of each month following the month in which you attended training.  VA will only issue a monthly housing payment after you verify your attendance to VA.  Please note, you may be responsible for any housing debts resulting from a reduction, withdrawal or termination of your program or changes to your eligibility.
